Instructions for running project on local machine:

1. Make sure that Python 2.7 is installed or install it.
2. Download the  the three python files `entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py` in this directory to the same directory in your local machine (only these three files - do not download any compiled .pyc files).
3. Run `entertainment_center.py` at the command line or in a python IDE/interpreter.
4. Now locate the file `fresh_tomatoes.html` and open in a web browser.  It will be in the same directory as the python files.
5. *Note*: all three python files need to be in the same directory in order for this to run properly. Also, your machine needs a live internet connection with decent bandwidth in order to display the `fresh_tomatoes.html` web page well.
